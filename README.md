# algorithm-for-file-updates-in-python

Python algorithm that updates a file to allow certain IP addresses to access content, and remove those that should not have access to that content within my imaginary organization.

## Project Description

In my organization, we manage restricted content access using an IP address allow list, which is tracked in the ```"allow_list.txt"``` file. We also maintain a distinct list for deactivating access to this content, which includes IP addresses that should no longer be granted entry. To enhance efficiency, I designed an algorithm for automating the process of updating the ```"allow_list.txt"``` file by removing IP addresses that are no longer authorized for access.

## Open the file that contains the allow list

In the first part of the algorithm, I opened the file ```“allow_list.txt”```. In order to do this, I first assigned this as a string to the variable ```import_file```:

After that, I used a ```with``` statement so that I could open the file:

Within my algorithm, I employ the ```with``` statement in conjunction with the ```open()``` function, configured in read mode, to access and read the allow list file. This approach will allow me to retrieve the IP addresses that are stored in the file. The ```with``` keyword serves the additional purpose of resource management by automatically closing the file when exiting the ```with``` statement.

Inside the code ```with open(import_file, "r") as file:```, the ```open()``` function takes two parameters. The first parameter specifies the file to be imported, while the second parameter defines the desired operation, which, in this case, is ```"r"``` for reading. The ```as``` keyword is used to assign the output of the ```open()``` function to a variable named ```file```, which allows me to work with the file content within the ```with``` statement.

## Read the file contents

To access the file's content, I employed the ```.read()``` method, which transforms the contents of ```file``` into a string.

By utilizing the ```.open()``` function with the ```"r"``` argument for reading, I can utilize the ```.read()``` function within the ```with``` statement. This method transforms the file into a string, enabling me to examine its contents. I invoked the ```.read()``` method on the ```file``` variable specified in the ```wit``` statement and stored the resulting string in the ```ip_addresses``` variable.

In other words, this code parses the contents of the ```"allow_list.txt"``` file, converting it into a string format that I can use at a later time to structure and extract data within my Python program.

## Convert the string into a list

To allow me to remove individual IP addresses from the allow list, I need the data to be in a list format. To achieve this, I proceeded by employing the ```.split()``` method, which converted the ```ip_addresses``` string into a list:

To transform the string variable into a list, I invoked the ```.split()``` function. This operation involves converting the string's content into a list structure. The main objective behind splitting ```ip_addresses``` into a list is to simplify the process of removing specific IP addresses from the allow list.

By default, the ```.split()``` function divides the text into list elements wherever it encounters whitespace. In this particular algorithm, the ```.split()``` function operates on the data contained in the ```ip_addresses variable```, which is a string comprising individual IP addresses separated by whitespace. This function effectively transforms this string into a list of IP addresses. To preserve this list, I reassigned it to the ```ip_addresses``` variable.

## Iterate through the remove list

An essential component of my algorithm revolves around the need to iterate through the IP addresses listed within the ```remove_list```. To accomplish this task, I integrated a ```for``` loop:

In Python, a ```for``` loop is utilized to execute a set of code instructions for a designated sequence. In a Python algorithm such as this one, the primary objective of the ```for``` loop is to implement specific code statements for each element within the sequence.

The ```for``` keyword initiates the ```for``` loop, followed by the loop variable, denoted as ```element```, and the ```in``` keyword. The ```in``` keyword signifies the iteration through the ```ip_addresses``` sequence, assigning each value in turn to the loop variable ```element```.
